# Where2

Where2 is a destination application. A user inputs two different cities in order to compare 
what weather would be better for their trip! When a user clicks search two fetch requests are sent getting information from the open weather API and the GeoDB Cities API. In response the application will then show the user the current weather as well as the next 5 days. It will also pull the current currency exchange rate.
